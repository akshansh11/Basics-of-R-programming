 #INDEXING FUNCTIONS
> #There are three important indexing functions 'which', 'match', '%in%'
> #'which' gives us the entries of the logical vectors which are true.
> x<-c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
> which(x)
[1] 2 4 5
> #'which' functions returns the indices value of x which are true
> #'match' looks for entries in a vector aand returns the index needed to access them.
> #Suppose instead of one state we need to find out the murder rate of many states.
> index<-match(c("New York","Florida", "Texas")murders$state)

> #'%in%' function is used to find out the common elements present in both vector spaces.
